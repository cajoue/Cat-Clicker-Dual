# cat-clicker-dual
Frontend Nanodegree project

Duplicated original repo cat-clicker-1 using this process: https://help.github.com/articles/duplicating-a-repository/

**New Requirements:** 
* We need two cats
* Cat name needs to be above the cat

**To Do:**
~* figure out how to dynamically make a link~
    - It wasn't so bad - just needed to sleep on it!
    - instead of replacing two %data% in separate steps
        + didn't work as the partial link seemed to be auto-completed, so the name of the link appeared out side it...
    - replaced single %data% with concatenated data
* add clickability to cats
